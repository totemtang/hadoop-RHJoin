We use two test cases to test RHJoin, Directed Join, Repartition Join and Broadcast Join. RHJoin need partition the reference table, while Directed Join need partition both tables.

====TPC-H====
We don't include TPC-H in this package. Users need generate the data of table "customer" and table "orders" by themselves.

After placing the two tables in proper place(See generateAndUpload.sh), users can use generateAndUpload.sh to partition the tables. This can also be done using Hive bucket mechanism. We provide the partition function for simplicity.

testTPCH.sh will test the four join methods.

====SkewData====
It is more convenient to use SkewData case since the data can be generated by the utils in this package.

Users can use SkewCase/generateAndUpload.sh to generate tables and their partitions.

SkewCase/testSkew.sh will test the four join methods.
